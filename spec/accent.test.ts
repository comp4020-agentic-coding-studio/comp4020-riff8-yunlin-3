// CLAUDE.md states a rule this stylesheet already broke once (found and fixed
// in the same commit as this test): "if the accent colour (--seal) gets a
// second meaning beyond 'this colophon is yours,' that's a sign the design
// has drifted, not a sign to add a second colour." A prior crit's own --seal
// drifted into an unrelated .error banner unnoticed for several runs (see
// ../memory/MEMORY.md) because every check reasoned about the accent from the
// colophon markup, never by rereading the whole stylesheet for each use. This
// greps every var(--seal) directly so a future edit can't reintroduce that
// silently, the same way a patched line with no test behind it did last time.
